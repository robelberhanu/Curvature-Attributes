# Curvature-Attributes

The following is the list of the attributes implemented in this program. Run the stript using Matlab (Desktop/Online). You may select the number that represents the curvature attribute when prompted to do so.

#### 1. Mean Curvature
#### 2.  Gaussian Curvature
#### 3.  Minimum Curvature
#### 4.  Maximum Curvature
#### 5.  Curvedness
#### 6.  ShapeIndex
#### 7.  MostPositiveCurvature
#### 8.  MostNegativeCurvature
#### 9.  DipProfile
#### 10.  Strike
#### 11.  Contour


This program was written to calculate 11 curvature attributes defined by (Robert, 2001).
